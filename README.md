## Project Outline
countdownGame.rkt is required to define a function that takes in two arguments.
- One will be a target number which is a randomly generated three digit integer between 101 and 999 inclusive.
- The other will be a list of 6 numbers selected at random from the list of 24 numbers: [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9,9,10,10,25,50,75,100].
This function should return a way of calculating the target number (or as near as possible) using the six numbers given in the second argument and the four basic mathimatical operations: * / + -
